# Style Guide Starter Templates
These templates are inspired by the book [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com), and its idea of creating a design system up-front before starting work on a new web design project.

This is a template with common elements and components used in every website (lists, buttons, etc.).

You can use this template to apply fonts and color palettes to develop your design system before starting work on the site design.
