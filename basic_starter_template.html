              <p>Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet? We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it. And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it. Lights flicker from the opposite loft. In this room the heat pipes just cough. The country music station plays soft, but there's nothing, really nothing to turn off. Just Louise and her lover so entwined, and these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.</p>

              <p class="pt-4">In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain, and the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train. We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane. Louise, she's all right, she's just near. She's delicate and seems like the mirror, but she just makes it all too concise and too clear that Johanna's not here. The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.</p>

                <p>They are fighting all over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Britain</a>. Rarely a night passes without an outbreak in some town or other. Sometimes it is a <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/11/04/89571241.html">mere skirmish</a> involving a few hundred police, but more often there is a pitched battle, with broken legs, crakced ribs and bloody noses. The police do their best, but it is well known that they are secretly in sympathy with the battlers.</p>
